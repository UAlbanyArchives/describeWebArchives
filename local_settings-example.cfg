access_requirements:
	The item contains web archives preserved as WARC files. They must be access though web archival replay tools such as the "Wayback Machine." The links here direct you to files hosted by the Internet Archive, but you may also request WARC files.
warc_restrict_note:
	Researchers interested in data analysis with web archives may request a WARC file. WARC files are very large and difficult to work with. Your request may take time to process, and we may be unable to deliver your request remotely. Please consult an archivist if you are interested in advanced research with web archives.
acqinfo_note:
	Web crawling is managed through the Internet Archive's Archive-It service.
general_internet_archive_note:
	This crawl was performed by the Internet Archive, not the UAlbany web archiving program, so the provenance is unknown.
